# ArcaneLogic.MonoGame.Input
Input helpers for the MonoGame framework


Includes a touch state machine that is reasonably performant and I think works better than the existing gesture engine.

Please note that this is prerelease and is broken right now from the port.  I'll update the nuget to 1.0.0 when it is ready.
